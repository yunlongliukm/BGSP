# 11 Bamboo Genome Sequencing Project

This project is focused on the sequencing of 11 bamboo genomes. The following sections provide a detailed overview of the project.

## Materials

The materials used in this project include:

- Bamboo samples from 11 different species
- Sequencing machines
- Bioinformatics software tools

## Sequencing Methods

The sequencing of the bamboo genomes was performed using Next-Generation Sequencing (NGS) technologies. The specific methods used include:

- Whole Genome Sequencing (WGS)
- RNA Sequencing (RNA-Seq)

## Genome Assembly

The genome assembly was performed using various bioinformatics tools. The general steps include:

1. Quality control of raw sequencing data
2. De novo assembly
3. Scaffolding and gap filling

## Gene Annotation Methods

The gene annotation was performed using a combination of ab initio prediction, homology-based prediction, and RNA-Seq data. The specific steps include:

1. Repeat masking
2. Ab initio gene prediction
3. Homology-based gene prediction
4. RNA-Seq based gene prediction
5. Functional annotation

## Comparative Genome Analysis

The comparative genome analysis was performed using various bioinformatics tools. The specific steps include:

1. Orthologous gene clustering
2. Phylogenetic tree construction
3. Divergence time estimation
4. Positive selection analysis

The codes used for the comparative genome analysis are available in the `code` directory of this repository.
